This study will examine the number of study subjects who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and who are infected over time, and refer subjects with positive research tests for an FDA approved test and then further care if confirmed positive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"margin-bottom: 12.0pt; border: none; padding: 0in;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Duration of participation is a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 12 months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"border: none; padding: 0in;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Activities of this study include completing on-line surveys; venous blood draw, self-collected blood samples, nasal swab and saliva sampling at enrollment, and 6 months and samples of nasal swabs bi-weekly from a sample of subjects. We may ask you to participate in testing and surveys at 1, 3, 9 and 12 months depending on the findings at baseline and also the level of the epidemic in the community. You will also have the option to participate in the use of a small Bluetooth beacon and mobile phone application to assist with understanding contacts among employees and students and how that may contribute to spread of the virus. We would also like to store leftover samples that we collect from you without identifying information, for future research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"margin-bottom: 12.0pt; border: none; padding: 0in;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Risks to participants include: Blood collection which can cause some discomfort. In rare cases, it may cause moderate pain, bruising, fainting or feeling lightheaded, excessive bleeding, scarring, calcified nodule, and infection. Swabbing of the inside of the nose for the nasal swab specimen may cause minimal discomfort and/or bleeding. You may also experience unintentional disclosure of the information provided on the surveys. As these tests are research tests, the results may be falsely positive or negative. Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Because the test for the virus (from the nasal swab/saliva) is a research test, if you test positive you will be referred for a confirmatory test. You may experience anxiety while you await the results of the confirmatory test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"border: none; padding: 0in;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Benefits: You will have access to regular research tests for SARS-COV-2 infection and referral for FDA approved confirmatory testing as part of this study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                               </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA      </span></td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                 </span></td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                            </span></td></tr>\n",

If you provide written informed consent, you will be asked to complete a baseline survey (this may take about ~25 minutes). You will be asked questions about current symptoms, known exposures to SARS-CoV-2, and use of prevention equipment such as masks but also adherence to hand hygiene, physical distancing and other prevention measures both at work and outside of work. You will also be asked about your workplace and household (e.g. number of people, occupations, location, etc.). You may decline to answer any questions you do not wish to answer. If you report symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, you will be asked to contact UNC-CH Employee Occupational Health, Campus Health or your healthcare provider for further screening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;â€¢ You will have about 5ml of blood collected from your arm using a venous blood draw. Â We will instruct and virtually observe you collect a nasal swab from the front of your nose (called a mid-turbinate nasal swab), and a saliva sample into a cup. The blood will be used for a laboratory-based test to detect any immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (antibodies) which would indicate prior exposure or infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For this project we are using two different antibody tests, one is an antibody test that has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA and the other is a test developed at UNC that is pending FDA approval.Â  If you test positive this does not mean that you are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and it is possible that the result could be a false positive. The nasal swabs and saliva will be used to detect the presence of the virus or SARS-CoV-2.Â  A portion of the blood samples, nasal swabs and saliva will be stored for up to 3 years to support future research on SARS CoV-2 and technologies to detect or address SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;â€¢ If you choose, you will be given a pre-programmed Bluetooth beacon with a unique identifier to use during work shifts. You will also receive instructions for downloading the Ethica app on your smartphone. The beacon broadcasts the unique identifier and can be read by smartphones running the Ethica app. In addition, beacons will also be placed throughout the workplace that can also be read by smartphones running the Ethica app. These interactions will determine your workplace interactions and may assist with better understanding how movement and interaction between study participants can contribute to infection with SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;The App/beacon does not have GPS thus cannot track your location, it only indicates if you come close to someone else with the App/beacon or come close to beacons located in laboratories and workplace settings.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                               </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA      </span></td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                 </span></td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                            </span></td></tr>\n",

You will have the option of being referred to the UNC Respiratory Diagnostic Center (RDC) for confirmatory testing and additional evaluation, or may choose to follow-up elsewhere. We will cover the cost of confirmatory testing at the RDC only. The tests we are providing through the study are research tests and cannot be used as a diagnostic test for SARS-COV-2; therefore, getting a confirmatory test in the event of positive research tests for COVID-19 will be highly recommended. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;â€¢ If your confirmatory PCR testing is positive for SARS-COV-2 indicative of active infection, you will be referred for standard care and management as other persons diagnosed with COVID-19 even if you have no symptoms.

For this project we are using an antibody test that has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA and another test developed at UNC that is pending FDA approval. The blood samples collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months will be tested Â with both assays.Â  We will provide you with the result of your antibody status determined with a FDA authorized test at the beginning of the study (baseline) Â and at 6 and 12 months. We will not be reporting results for samples collected using the UNC-developed test until it receives FDA authorization.Â  A positive result means you are likely to have been infected with SARS-COV-2 in the past.Â  It does not mean you have protective immunity to the virus.

Study records and specimens will be kept in secure, locked locations. All specimens and most records will be labeled only with a code number. Despite our best efforts to keep your information private, it is possible that the information could be obtained by someone who should not have it. If this were to happen, you could be treated badly or unfairly. You could feel stress or embarrassment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;To reduce these risks, we will use highly trained staff and provide clear protocols for taking samples. We will show you how to collect samples the first time and provide instructional videos as well. We also can provide ongoing instruction and supervision for sample collection if needed. Additionally, the survey software used for storing the data will keep your identifying information separate from the answers you provide to the surveys. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;In regards to the App, no detailed location information will be saved. The data collected will only include general information about interactions between consented study participants. Any contacts outside the UNC campus will NOT be tracked (only whether two study participants interacted at all). Information will not be shared with anyone outside of the study team.Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Please tell the researchers about any concerns or problems you have during this study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;The study team does not have the capacity to provide medical care. However, being a participant of the study does not mean that you should not seek medical treatment, should your symptoms require medical attention. If at any time you feel you need medical attention, please seek care and treatment from UNC Health or your primary care provider immediately. For urgent health care concerns, please visit UNC during business hours or contact UNC HealthLink at 984-974-6302.

The beacon identifier does not contain any personal information and cannot be linked to you without the file that links participant identifiers to beacon identifiers (which will be stored on a secure server and only be accessible by study personnel). You are able to turn the Bluetooth off on your smartphone temporarily to stop finding beacons. You are also able to drop out of this part of the study through the application. This prevents any further data collection for you, unless you decide to re-enroll. Lastly, you have the direct option to delete your data collected through the Ethica app, if you desire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;None of your blood samples will be used for commercial profit. The data and/or specimens you provide will be stored securely and handled with identification numbers only, so that your name will not appear in any research results. Survey data will be stored in password-protected, encrypted databases. You will not be identified in any reports of this study and your information will be removed from any data and/or specimens once the study has ended. It is possible that study data and/or specimens will be stored and used for future research, but they will not contain information that could identify you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;The consent process and questionnaire completion will be done electronically using a web-based, secure, database platform designed for research purposes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Although every effort will be made to keep research records private, there may be times when federal or state law requires the disclosure of such records, including personal information. This is very unlikely, but if disclosure is ever required, UNC-Chapel Hill will take steps allowable by law to protect the privacy of personal information. In some cases, your information in this research study could be reviewed by representatives of the University, research sponsors, or government agencies (for example, the FDA) for purposes such as quality control or safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Under North Carolina law, confidentiality does not extend to certain communicable diseases, such as TB, HIV, hepatitis, or other illnesses that put others at risk.

This study will examine the number of study subjects who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and who are infected over time, and refer subjects with positive research tests for an FDA approved test and then further care if confirmed positive.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 12.0pt; border: none; padding: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Duration of participation is a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 12 months.</span></p> <p style=\"border: none; padding: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Activities of this study include completing on-line surveys; venous blood draw, self-collected blood samples, nasal swab and saliva sampling at enrollment, and 6 months and samples of nasal swabs bi-weekly from a sample of subjects. We may ask you to participate in testing and surveys at 1, 3, 9 and 12 months depending on the findings at baseline and also the level of the epidemic in the community. You will also have the option to participate in the use of a small Bluetooth beacon and mobile phone application to assist with understanding contacts among employees and students and how that may contribute to spread of the virus. We would also like to store leftover samples that we collect from you without identifying information, for future research.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 12.0pt; border: none; padding: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Risks to participants include: Blood collection which can cause some discomfort. In rare cases, it may cause moderate pain, bruising, fainting or feeling lightheaded, excessive bleeding, scarring, calcified nodule, and infection. Swabbing of the inside of the nose for the nasal swab specimen may cause minimal discomfort and/or bleeding. You may also experience unintentional disclosure of the information provided on the surveys. As these tests are research tests, the results may be falsely positive or negative. Â </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Because the test for the virus (from the nasal swab/saliva) is a research test, if you test positive you will be referred for a confirmatory test.

Â We will instruct and virtually observe you collect a nasal swab from the front of your nose (called a mid-turbinate nasal swab), and a saliva sample into a cup. The blood will be used for a laboratory-based test to detect any immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (antibodies) which would indicate prior exposure or infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For this project we are using two different antibody tests, one is an antibody test that has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA and the other is a test developed at UNC that is pending FDA approval.Â  If you test positive this does not mean that you are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and it is possible that the result could be a false positive. The nasal swabs and saliva will be used to detect the presence of the virus or SARS-CoV-2.Â  A portion of the blood samples, nasal swabs and saliva will be stored for up to 3 years to support future research on SARS CoV-2 and technologies to detect or address SARS-CoV-2.</span> </strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">â€¢ If you choose, you will be given a pre-programmed Bluetooth beacon with a unique identifier to use during work shifts. You will also receive instructions for downloading the Ethica app on your smartphone. The beacon broadcasts the unique identifier and can be read by smartphones running the Ethica app. In addition, beacons will also be placed throughout the workplace that can also be read by smartphones running the Ethica app. These interactions will determine your workplace interactions and may assist with better understanding how movement and interaction between study participants can contribute to infection with SARS-CoV-2.</span> <strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The App/beacon does not have GPS thus cannot track your location, it only indicates if you come close to someone else with the App/beacon or come close to beacons located in laboratories and workplace settings.</span> </strong></p></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & NA                                                                                                                                & NA         & NA       & NA & NA & NA & NA                                                                                                  & NA & NA & NA & NA & NA & NA                            \\\\\n",

Â This self-collected device is placed on your arm where it sticks with a light adhesive. You press a button and a lancet pricks your arm and the suction from the device draws blood into the self-contained device. It collects about 80 micro liters of blood which is less than a 50th of a teaspoon of blood.

If this were to happen, you could be treated badly or unfairly. You could feel stress or embarrassment. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">To reduce these risks, we will use highly trained staff and provide clear protocols for taking samples. We will show you how to collect samples the first time and provide instructional videos as well. We also can provide ongoing instruction and supervision for sample collection if needed.

We may ask you to participate in testing and surveys at 1, 3, 9 and 12 months depending on the findings at baseline and also the level of the epidemic in the community. You will also have the option to participate in the use of a small Bluetooth beacon and mobile phone application to assist with understanding contacts among employees and students and how that may contribute to spread of the virus. We would also like to store leftover samples that we collect from you without identifying information, for future research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"margin-bottom: 12.0pt; border: none; padding: 0in;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Risks to participants include: Blood collection which can cause some discomfort. In rare cases, it may cause moderate pain, bruising, fainting or feeling lightheaded, excessive bleeding, scarring, calcified nodule, and infection. Swabbing of the inside of the nose for the nasal swab specimen may cause minimal discomfort and/or bleeding. You may also experience unintentional disclosure of the information provided on the surveys. As these tests are research tests, the results may be falsely positive or negative. Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Because the test for the virus (from the nasal swab/saliva) is a research test, if you test positive you will be referred for a confirmatory test. You may experience anxiety while you await the results of the confirmatory test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"border: none; padding: 0in;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;Benefits: You will have access to regular research tests for SARS-COV-2 infection and referral for FDA approved confirmatory testing as part of this study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | NA                                                                                                                                | NA         | NA       | NA | NA | NA | NA                                                                                                  | NA | NA | NA | NA | NA | NA                             |\n",

If you provide written informed consent, you will be asked to complete a baseline survey (this may take about ~25 minutes). You will be asked questions about current symptoms, known exposures to SARS-CoV-2, and use of prevention equipment such as masks but also adherence to hand hygiene, physical distancing and other prevention measures both at work and outside of work. You will also be asked about your workplace and household (e.g. number of people, occupations, location, etc.). You may decline to answer any questions you do not wish to answer. If you report symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, you will be asked to contact UNC-CH Employee Occupational Health, Campus Health or your healthcare provider for further screening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;â€¢ You will have about 5ml of blood collected from your arm using a venous blood draw. Â We will instruct and virtually observe you collect a nasal swab from the front of your nose (called a mid-turbinate nasal swab), and a saliva sample into a cup. The blood will be used for a laboratory-based test to detect any immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (antibodies) which would indicate prior exposure or infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For this project we are using two different antibody tests, one is an antibody test that has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA and the other is a test developed at UNC that is pending FDA approval.Â  If you test positive this does not mean that you are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and it is possible that the result could be a false positive. The nasal swabs and saliva will be used to detect the presence of the virus or SARS-CoV-2.Â  A portion of the blood samples, nasal swabs and saliva will be stored for up to 3 years to support future research on SARS CoV-2 and technologies to detect or address SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;â€¢ If you choose, you will be given a pre-programmed Bluetooth beacon with a unique identifier to use during work shifts. You will also receive instructions for downloading the Ethica app on your smartphone. The beacon broadcasts the unique identifier and can be read by smartphones running the Ethica app. In addition, beacons will also be placed throughout the workplace that can also be read by smartphones running the Ethica app. These interactions will determine your workplace interactions and may assist with better understanding how movement and interaction between study participants can contribute to infection with SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;The App/beacon does not have GPS thus cannot track your location, it only indicates if you come close to someone else with the App/beacon or come close to beacons located in laboratories and workplace settings.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | NA                                                                                                                                | NA         | NA       | NA | NA | NA | NA                                                                                                  | NA | NA | NA | NA | NA | NA                             |\n",

You will have the option of being referred to the UNC Respiratory Diagnostic Center (RDC) for confirmatory testing and additional evaluation, or may choose to follow-up elsewhere. We will cover the cost of confirmatory testing at the RDC only. The tests we are providing through the study are research tests and cannot be used as a diagnostic test for SARS-COV-2; therefore, getting a confirmatory test in the event of positive research tests for COVID-19 will be highly recommended. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;â€¢ If your confirmatory PCR testing is positive for SARS-COV-2 indicative of active infection, you will be referred for standard care and management as other persons diagnosed with COVID-19 even if you have no symptoms. You should not report to work if you receive a positive result from the RDC until you have been cleared by UNC-CH Employee Occupational Health, Campus Health or your healthcare provider. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;â€¢ As part of routine care, the local health department, UNC-CH Employee Occupational Health, Campus Health will conduct contact tracing or investigation for any study participants identified with active SARS-COV-2 infection, which will not be a part of the study. In addition, you will be contacted by study personnel for additional information including your health outcomes, the number of contacts in your workplace, and additional research tests if you are identified with COVID-19 infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serology tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"&gt;If you have a positive serology test this is indicative of past infection. For this project we are using an antibody test that has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA and another test developed at UNC that is pending FDA approval. The blood samples collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months will be tested Â with both assays.Â  We will provide you with the result of your antibody status determined with a FDA authorized test at the beginning of the study (baseline) Â and at 6 and 12 months. We will not be reporting results for samples collected using the UNC-developed test until it receives FDA authorization.Â  A positive result means you are likely to have been infected with SARS-COV-2 in the past.Â  It does not mean you have protective immunity to the virus.

This study will examine the number of study subjects who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and who are infected over time, and refer subjects with positive research tests for an FDA approved test and then further care if confirmed positive.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 12.0pt; border: none; padding: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Duration of participation is a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 12 months.</span></p> <p style=\"border: none; padding: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Activities of this study include completing on-line surveys; venous blood draw, self-collected blood samples, nasal swab and saliva sampling at enrollment, and 6 months and samples of nasal swabs bi-weekly from a sample of subjects. We may ask you to participate in testing and surveys at 1, 3, 9 and 12 months depending on the findings at baseline and also the level of the epidemic in the community. You will also have the option to participate in the use of a small Bluetooth beacon and mobile phone application to assist with understanding contacts among employees and students and how that may contribute to spread of the virus. We would also like to store leftover samples that we collect from you without identifying information, for future research.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 12.0pt; border: none; padding: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Risks to participants include: Blood collection which can cause some discomfort. In rare cases, it may cause moderate pain, bruising, fainting or feeling lightheaded, excessive bleeding, scarring, calcified nodule, and infection. Swabbing of the inside of the nose for the nasal swab specimen may cause minimal discomfort and/or bleeding. You may also experience unintentional disclosure of the information provided on the surveys. As these tests are research tests, the results may be falsely positive or negative. Â </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Because the test for the virus (from the nasal swab/saliva) is a research test, if you test positive you will be referred for a confirmatory test.

If you provide written informed consent, you will be asked to complete a baseline survey (this may take about ~25 minutes). You will be asked questions about current symptoms, known exposures to SARS-CoV-2, and use of prevention equipment such as masks but also adherence to hand hygiene, physical distancing and other prevention measures both at work and outside of work. You will also be asked about your workplace and household (e.g. number of people, occupations, location, etc.). You may decline to answer any questions you do not wish to answer. If you report symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, you will be asked to contact UNC-CH Employee Occupational Health, Campus Health or your healthcare provider for further screening. </span></p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">â€¢ You will have about 5ml of blood collected from your arm using a venous blood draw. Â We will instruct and virtually observe you collect a nasal swab from the front of your nose (called a mid-turbinate nasal swab), and a saliva sample into a cup. The blood will be used for a laboratory-based test to detect any immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (antibodies) which would indicate prior exposure or infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For this project we are using two different antibody tests, one is an antibody test that has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA and the other is a test developed at UNC that is pending FDA approval.Â  If you test positive this does not mean that you are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and it is possible that the result could be a false positive. The nasal swabs and saliva will be used to detect the presence of the virus or SARS-CoV-2.Â  A portion of the blood samples, nasal swabs and saliva will be stored for up to 3 years to support future research on SARS CoV-2 and technologies to detect or address SARS-CoV-2.</span> </strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">â€¢ If you choose, you will be given a pre-programmed Bluetooth beacon with a unique identifier to use during work shifts. You will also receive instructions for downloading the Ethica app on your smartphone. The beacon broadcasts the unique identifier and can be read by smartphones running the Ethica app. In addition, beacons will also be placed throughout the workplace that can also be read by smartphones running the Ethica app. These interactions will determine your workplace interactions and may assist with better understanding how movement and interaction between study participants can contribute to infection with SARS-CoV-2.</span> <strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The App/beacon does not have GPS thus cannot track your location, it only indicates if you come close to someone else with the App/beacon or come close to beacons located in laboratories and workplace settings.</span> </strong></p></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

If this were to happen, you could be treated badly or unfairly. You could feel stress or embarrassment. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">To reduce these risks, we will use highly trained staff and provide clear protocols for taking samples.

This means that no one looking at the labels or at other information will be able to know that the samples or information came from you. We will have a separate clinician who will be able to link a positive test result back to your contact information so that this stays protected and confidential. The beacon identifier does not contain any personal information and cannot be linked to you without the file that links participant identifiers to beacon identifiers (which will be stored on a secure server and only be accessible by study personnel). You are able to turn the Bluetooth off on your smartphone temporarily to stop finding beacons. You are also able to drop out of this part of the study through the application. This prevents any further data collection for you, unless you decide to re-enroll. Lastly, you have the direct option to delete your data collected through the Ethica app, if you desire.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">None of your blood samples will be used for commercial profit. The data and/or specimens you provide will be stored securely and handled with identification numbers only, so that your name will not appear in any research results. Survey data will be stored in password-protected, encrypted databases. You will not be identified in any reports of this study and your information will be removed from any data and/or specimens once the study has ended. It is possible that study data and/or specimens will be stored and used for future research, but they will not contain information that could identify you.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The consent process and questionnaire completion will be done electronically using a web-based, secure, database platform designed for research purposes.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Although every effort will be made to keep research records private, there may be times when federal or state law requires the disclosure of such records, including personal information. This is very unlikely, but if disclosure is ever required, UNC-Chapel Hill will take steps allowable by law to protect the privacy of personal information. In some cases, your information in this research study could be reviewed by representatives of the University, research sponsors, or government agencies (for example, the FDA) for purposes such as quality control or safety.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Under North Carolina law, confidentiality does not extend to certain communicable diseases, such as TB, HIV, hepatitis, or other illnesses that put others at risk. If the researchers become aware that subjects have such an illness, they are required to report it to state.</span></p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Will you receive study results of future research involving your specimens?</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Most research with your specimens is not expected to yield new information that would be meaningful to share with you personally.
